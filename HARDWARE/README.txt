NeuroBytes v0.9 is the ninth hardware iteration of the NeuroBytes project, a product designed and manufactured by NeuroTinker, LLC. The project is released under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 3 (LICENSE.txt). These boards are still to be considered prototypes, and as such may have bugs and mistakes that have not yet been recognized or fixed.

Changes vs NeuroBytes v0.8:

- Added on-board potentiometer
- Both axon signals now route to hardware PWM-capable pins
- Added on-board LDO and associated capacitors
- Added Schottky diode on microcontroller voltage rail
- Added OSHW logo to silkscreen
- Reduced LED hole size slightly
- Added pogo pads for testing axons, dendrites, etc.
- Changed MODE switch to standard type (vs right-angle)
- General silkscreen improvements/simplifications

Note that the PCB design file includes three copies of the board, along with a pogo rig breakout and a few accessory boards.
